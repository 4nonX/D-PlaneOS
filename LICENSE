Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your
licenses.

Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software
to do everything you might do with the software that would
otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any
permitted purpose, other than distributing the software or
making changes or new works based on the software.

Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
distribute copies of the software. Your license to distribute
covers distributing the software with changes and new works
permitted by the change and new works license.

Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with Required Notice: that the licensor provided
with the software. For example:

    Required Notice: Copyright 2025-2026 D-PlaneOS Contributors

No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.
If your employer makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your employer.

Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the
software not covered by your licenses, the violation is
automatically fixed if you stop violating these terms within
30 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end
immediately.

No Liability

As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.

Definitions

The licensor is the entity offering these terms, and the
software is the software the licensor makes available under
these terms.

You means the recipient of the software.

Your company is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or
other kind of organization that you work for, plus all
organizations that have control over, are under the control
of, or are under common control with that organization.
Control means ownership of substantially all the assets of an
entity, or the power to direct its management and legal
affairs.

Your licenses are all the licenses granted to you for the
software under these terms.

Use means anything you do with the software requiring one of
your licenses.

Trademark

The licensor has not granted any trademark license. You may
not use the licensor's name, logo, or trademarks in any way
that suggests your products or services are made or endorsed
by the licensor.

No Competing Uses

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing to
others any product that competes with the software or any
product the licensor or any of its affiliates currently makes,
sells, offers for sale, distributes, or otherwise provides,
whether on a paid or royalty-free basis.
