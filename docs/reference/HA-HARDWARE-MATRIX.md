# DPlaneOS HA Hardware Compatibility Matrix

## SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations (PR) Support for Path A

This matrix documents which storage controllers, JBODs, and SANs support SCSI-3 PR (Persistent Reservations) - required for DPlaneOS Path A (shared-storage HA) topology.

**Test Method:** PROUT write-probe (only reliable test). Read-only checks are insufficient.

```
POST /api/ha/scsi/probe
```

This endpoint returns:
- `"supported": true` - device responds to PROUT register/unregister
- `"supported": false` - device ignores or rejects PROUT
- Error - device unreachable

## Testing and Validation

### Before Production Deployment

Run the PROUT probe on all pool disks:

```bash
# From DPlaneOS UI
Settings → High Availability → SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations → Probe PR Support on Pool Disks

# Or via CLI
curl -X POST http://NODE_IP:5000/api/ha/scsi/probe | jq '.devices'

# Expected output (all "supported": true):
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "path": "/dev/sg0",
      "major": 21,
      "minor": 0,
      "model": "Areca ARC-5028 JBOD",
      "supported": true,
      "latency_ms": 2
    },
    {
      "path": "/dev/sg1",
      "major": 21,
      "minor": 1,
      "model": "Areca ARC-5028 JBOD",
      "supported": true,
      "latency_ms": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Interpreting Probe Results

- ✅ `"supported": true` - Device is SCSI-3 PR compliant. Safe for Path A.
- ❌ `"supported": false` - Device does NOT support SCSI-3 PR.
  - **Action:** Update firmware (if available) or switch to Path B topology.
- ⚠️ Timeout or error - Device unreachable.
  - **Action:** Check connections; may be multipath issue. Retry after checking.

### Regression Testing

After firmware updates or hardware changes, re-run probe to confirm PR support:

```bash
# Baseline (before firmware update)
curl -X POST http://NODE_IP:5000/api/ha/scsi/probe > /tmp/probe-before.json

# Update firmware on array/JBOD

# Validate PR still works
curl -X POST http://NODE_IP:5000/api/ha/scsi/probe > /tmp/probe-after.json
diff /tmp/probe-before.json /tmp/probe-after.json
```

## Adding Your Hardware

If you deploy DPlaneOS HA on hardware not listed above, please share results:

1. Run PROUT probe:
```bash
curl -X POST http://YOUR_NODE:5000/api/ha/scsi/probe | jq '.devices[] | {model, supported}' > /tmp/your-hw.json
```

2. Include in bug report:
   - Hardware model (e.g., "Areca ARC-5028")
   - Firmware version (e.g., "1.52")
   - Probe results (supported: true/false)
   - Any issues encountered (if failed)

3. Submit to: https://github.com/dplane/dplaneos/issues/new?title=HA%20Hardware%20Test%3A%20[Vendor]%20[Model]

## Migration: Unsupported Hardware → Path B

If your hardware doesn't support SCSI-3 PR:

1. **Disable HA:**
   Settings → High Availability → Disable HA

2. **Back up data** (replication to external target)

3. **Switch to Path B (replicated topology):**
   Settings → High Availability → Enable HA → Select "Replicated ZFS" path

4. **Advantages of Path B:**
   - Works with any storage (SATA, NVMe, network-attached)
   - No special firmware requirements
   - Simpler troubleshooting
   - **Disadvantage:** RPO is non-zero (up to replication interval lag)

## Troubleshooting: Probe Says "Not Supported" But Hardware Should Work

### Step 1: Verify Device Model

```bash
# Check what device model the kernel sees
sg_inq /dev/sg0 | grep "Product"

# Compare against this matrix
# If it's a different model/version, vendor name may be misleading
```

### Step 2: Check Firmware Version

```bash
# Query device firmware
sg_vpd /dev/sg0 | grep -i "firmware\|revision"

# Compare against matrix
# Many devices need firmware update to enable PR
```

### Step 3: Verify Controller Settings

Some controllers require PR to be explicitly enabled:

```bash
# Broadcom MegaRAID example
# SSH to RAID controller management console and enable:
#   Enable Persistent Reservations = Yes

# Dell PERC (in iLO/DRAC):
#   System Settings → Storage → PR Mode = Enabled
```

### Step 4: Check for Multipath Issues

If using device mapper (multipath), ensure all paths report the same PR support:

```bash
# For each path, run probe
for sg in /dev/sg*; do
  echo "Testing $sg:"
  timeout 2 sg_persist --read-keys $sg 2>&1 | head -3
done
```

All paths should show similar response (some may timeout if not connected).

### Step 5: Force Firmware Update

Some vendors require specific firmware versions:

```bash
# Example: Adaptec ASC-3720
# Download firmware from vendor (version 8.00+)
# Flash via BIOS/RAID management utility
# Reboot
# Re-run probe
```

---

## Advanced: Custom Hardware Testing

If your hardware is not listed, you can manually test SCSI-3 PR support:

```bash
# Test 1: Check SCSI-3 version support
sg_vpd --all /dev/sg0 | grep "SCSI version\|Compliance"
# Should show "SPC-4" or higher (SPC-5 is latest)

# Test 2: Try a read-keys query (non-destructive)
sg_persist --read-keys --in /dev/sg0
# If this times out, device doesn't support persistent reservation

# Test 3: Try registering a test key (destructive!)
# WARNING: Only run on test disk, not production data
sg_persist --register --aptpl /dev/sg0 -S test-key
# If this succeeds, device supports PR

# Cleanup (unregister test key)
sg_persist --release /dev/sg0
```
