### Memory Compatibility

#### ECC vs Non-ECC

| RAM Type | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **ECC Unbuffered** | ✅ Recommended | Best for data integrity |

| **Non-ECC** | ⚠️ Supported | See NON-ECC-WARNING.md |

**Non-ECC Limitations:**
- Risk of silent data corruption (2-4 bit flips/month on 16GB)
- ZFS protects disk, NOT RAM
- Acceptable for:
  - Home use with backups
  - Non-critical data
  - Media libraries
- NOT recommended for:
  - Production databases
  - Critical business data
  - Compliance requirements

#### Memory Sizes

| RAM Size | Status | Auto-Tuned Settings |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **2GB** | ⚠️ Minimal | ARC: 512MB, Inotify: 65K |
| **4GB** | ✅ Low-End | ARC: 1GB, Inotify: 131K |
| **8GB** | ✅ Good | ARC: 2GB, Inotify: 262K |
| **16GB** | ✅ Great | ARC: 4GB, Inotify: 524K |
| **32GB** | ✅ Excellent | ARC: 8GB, Inotify: 1M |
| **64GB** | ✅ High-end | ARC: 16GB, Inotify: 1M |
| **128GB+** | ✅ High-end | ARC: 32GB, Inotify: 1M |

**Virtualized Systems:**
- ARC reduced by 25%
- Inotify reduced by 50%
- Worker threads unchanged

## Auto-Tuning Behavior

### How It Works

1. **Installation starts** → Hardware detection runs
2. **System scans:**
   - CPU: Vendor, cores, threads
   - RAM: Total, ECC status
   - Storage: ZFS/Btrfs availability, disk types
   - Platform: Bare metal vs virtualized
3. **Auto-tune settings:**
   - ZFS ARC limit
   - Inotify watches
   - Worker threads
4. **Apply configuration**
5. **Save profile** for future reference

### Example Auto-Tuning

#### Scenario 1: Budget Home Server
```
CPU: Intel Celeron J4125 (4 cores)
RAM: 8GB DDR4 (Non-ECC)
Storage: 500GB SSD + 4x 4TB HDD (ZFS RAID-Z1)
Platform: Bare Metal

Auto-Tuned:
  ZFS ARC: 2GB
  Inotify: 262,144 watches
  Workers: 2 threads
  
Result: ✅ Smooth operation for home media server
```

#### Scenario 2: High-End Server
```
CPU: AMD EPYC 7452 (32 cores, 64 threads)
RAM: 128GB DDR4 ECC
Storage: 2x 1TB NVMe + 24x 8TB HDD (ZFS RAID-Z2)
Platform: Bare Metal

Auto-Tuned:
  ZFS ARC: 32GB
  Inotify: 1,048,576 watches
  Workers: 8 threads
  
Result: ✅ High-performance production storage
```

#### Scenario 3: Raspberry Pi 4
```
CPU: ARM Cortex-A72 (4 cores)
RAM: 4GB LPDDR4
Storage: 64GB microSD + USB 3.0 external HDD
Platform: Bare Metal

Auto-Tuned:
  ZFS ARC: 1GB
  Inotify: 131,072 watches
  Workers: 2 threads
  Recommendation: Use ext4 instead of ZFS for better performance
  
Result: ✅ Works, but ZFS operations slow
```

#### Scenario 4: VM on Proxmox
```
CPU: 4 vCPUs (host: Ryzen 9 5950X)
RAM: 16GB (host has 64GB ECC)
Storage: Virtual disk on ZFS pool
Platform: KVM (Proxmox)

Auto-Tuned:
  ZFS ARC: 3GB (reduced for VM)
  Inotify: 262,144 watches (reduced for VM)
  Workers: 2 threads
  
Result: ✅ Conservative tuning for virtualized environment
```

## Unsupported / Problematic Hardware

### Will NOT Work

❌ **32-bit x86** - Requires 64-bit CPU  
❌ **<2GB RAM** - Insufficient for D-PlaneOS + ZFS  
❌ **Proprietary RAID cards in RAID mode** - ZFS can't see individual disks

### Works But Not Recommended

⚠️ **Non-ECC RAM >32GB** - High bit-flip risk  
⚠️ **WiFi only** - Unstable for NAS  
⚠️ **USB 2.0 storage** - Too slow  
⚠️ **SMR HDDs** - Very slow with ZFS (use CMR)

## Performance Expectations

### File Operations

| Hardware Tier | Sequential Read | Sequential Write | Random IOPS |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Budget (4GB, HDD)** | 100-150 MB/s | 80-120 MB/s | 50-100 |
| **Mid-Range (16GB, SSD)** | 400-550 MB/s | 350-500 MB/s | 5K-10K |
| **High-End (32GB+, NVMe)** | 1-3 GB/s | 1-2.5 GB/s | 50K-200K |

### Concurrent Users

| Hardware Tier | Light Use | Medium Use | Heavy Use |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Budget** | 5 users | 2 users | 1 user |
| **Mid-Range** | 20 users | 10 users | 5 users |
| **High-End** | 50+ users | 30 users | 15 users |

## Upgrade Paths

### Budget → Mid-Range
1. Add RAM (8GB → 16GB)
2. Add SSD for OS
3. Result: 3-5x performance boost

### Mid-Range → High-End
1. Upgrade to ECC RAM
2. Add NVMe for cache
3. Upgrade to 10GbE
4. Result: High performance

### Home → Production
1. **Must have:**
   - ECC RAM
   - Redundant power supplies
   - IPMI/out-of-band management
2. **Recommended:**
   - Hot-swap drive bays
   - Dual NICs with bonding
   - UPS integration

## Troubleshooting by Hardware Type

### Raspberry Pi Issues

**Problem:** System slow/unstable  
**Solution:**
1. Use ext4 instead of ZFS
2. Boot from SSD, not microSD
3. Disable swap
4. Limit indexing to on-demand only

### Low RAM Systems (<8GB)

**Problem:** Out of memory errors  
**Solution:**
1. Reduce ZFS ARC manually
2. Use periodic indexing only
3. Disable unnecessary services
4. Consider adding swap (on SSD)

### Virtualized Systems

**Problem:** Poor performance  
**Solution:**
1. Give VM direct access to disks (passthrough)
2. Don't nest ZFS (host uses ZFS, VM uses ext4)
3. Allocate at least 8GB RAM to VM
4. Use virtio drivers

### Old Hardware (<2015)

**Problem:** Slow, high CPU usage  
**Solution:**
1. Use ext4/XFS instead of ZFS
2. Disable real-time indexing
3. Reduce worker threads
4. Consider hardware upgrade

## Conclusion

**D-PlaneOS works on virtually any hardware:**
- ✅ Auto-detects capabilities
- ✅ Tunes itself accordingly
- ✅ Degrades gracefully on low-end systems
- ✅ Scales up to high-end servers

**Minimum to run:** 2GB RAM, 1 CPU core  
**Recommended for good experience:** 8GB RAM, 4 CPU threads  
**Optimal for full features:** 16GB+ RAM, 8+ CPU threads, ECC

**The system will NEVER refuse to install** - it adapts to your hardware.
